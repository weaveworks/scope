## Release 0.15.0

Highlights:

This release comes with:
  * Search: new smart search field that allows you to filter what you can see by
    container names, all kinds of metadata, e.g., IP addresses, and metric
    comparisons, e.g., CPU > 50%.
  * Enhanced Kubernetes Visualization: namespace filters, ReplicaSet/Deployment
    views, extra metadata, better navigation, show Pod logs, delete Pods,
	bugfixes and more ...
  * Scope App performance improvements: ~3X reduction in CPU consumption.

## Release 0.14.0

Highlights:

This release comes with two main new features.
  * Probe plugins: Now you can create your HTTP-based plugin to provide new metrics
    and display them in Scope. You can read more about it and see some examples
    [here](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/tree/master/examples/plugins).
  * Metrics on canvas: Metrics are now displayed on the nodes and not just on
    the details panel, starting with CPU and memory consumption.

Also, the performance of the UI has been considerably improved and the 100-node
rendering limit has been lifted.
