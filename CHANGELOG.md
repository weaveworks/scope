    and display them in Scope. You can read more about it and see some examples
    [here](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/tree/master/examples/plugins).
  * Metrics on canvas: Metrics are now displayed on the nodes and not just on
    the details panel, starting with CPU and memory consumption.

Also, the performance of the UI has been considerably improved and the 100-node
rendering limit has been lifted.
