Sign your work
We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as a additional safeguard for the OpenEBS project. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please read developer-certificate-of-origin. If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your user.name and user.email git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s. You can also use git aliases like git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'. Now you can commit with git ci and the commit will be signed.
