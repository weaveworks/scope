# Weave Scope - Monitoring, visualisation & management for Docker & Kubernetes

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/scope/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/weaveworks/scope/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/weaveworks/scope/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/weaveworks/scope) [![Slack Status](https://weave-scope-slack.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://weave-scope-slack.herokuapp.com) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/weaveworks/scope)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/weaveworks/scope)

Weave Scope automatically generates a map of your application, enabling you to
intuitively understand, monitor, and control your containerized, microservices based application.

### Understand your Docker containers in real-time

<img src="imgs/topology.png" width="200" alt="Map you architecture" align="right">

Choose an overview of your container infrastructure, or focus on a specific microservice. Easily identify and correct issues to ensure the stability and performance of your containerized applications.

### Contextual details and deep linking

<img src="imgs/selected.png" width="200" alt="Focus on a single container" align="right">

View contextual metrics, tags and metadata for your containers.  Effortlessly navigate between processes inside your container to hosts your containers run on, arranged in expandable, sortable tables.  Easily to find the container using the most CPU or memory for a given host or service.

### Interact with and manage containers

<img src="imgs/terminals.png" width="200" alt="Launch a command line." align="right">

Interact with your containers directly: pause, restart and stop containers. Launch a command line. All without leaving the scope browser window.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting started

```
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/scope https://git.io/scope
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope
sudo scope launch
```

This script will download and run a recent Scope image from the Docker Hub.
Now, open your web browser to **http://localhost:4040**. (If you're using
boot2docker, replace localhost with the output of `boot2docker ip`.)

Your feedback is always welcome!

## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

Scope does not need any configuration and does not require the Weave Network.
Scope does need to be running on every machine you want to monitor.

Scope allows anyone with access to the UI control over your containers: as
such, the Scope app endpoint (port 4040) should not be made accessible on
the Internet.  Additionally traffic between the app and the probe is currently
insecure and should not traverse the internet.

Scope will periodically check with our servers to see if a new version is
available.  To disable this, run:

```
CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=true scope launch
```

For more information, [read this](https://github.com/weaveworks/go-checkpoint).

## <a name="architecture"></a>Architecture

Weave Scope consists of two components: the app and the probe. These two
components are deployed as a single Docker container using the `scope`
script.

The probe is responsible for gathering information about the host is it running
on. This information is sent to the app in the form of a report. The app is
responsible for processing reports from the probe into usable topologies,
serving the UI, and pushing these topologies to the UI.

## <a name="using-weave-scope-in-standalone-mode"></a>Using Weave Scope in Standalone Mode

When running Scope in a cluster, each probe sends reports to each app.
The App merges the reports from each probe into a more complete report.
You need to run Scope on every machine you want to monitor.

```
+--Docker host----------+      +--Docker host----------+

|  |                 |  |      |  |                 |  |
|  +-----------------+  |      |  +-----------------+  |
+-----------------------+      +-----------------------+
```

If you run Scope on the same machine as the Weave Network, the probe will use
weaveDNS to automatically discover other apps on your network. Scope achieves
this by registering itself under the address **scope.weave.local**. Each probe
will send reports to every app registered under this address. Therefore, if
you have a running weaveDNS setup, you do not need to take any further steps.

If you do not wish to use weaveDNS, you can instruct Scope to cluster with
other Scope instances on the command line. Hostnames and IP addresses are
acceptable, both with and without ports:

```
# scope launch scope1:4030 192.168.0.12 192.168.0.11:4030
```

Hostnames will be regularly resolved as A records, and each answer used as a
target.

## <a name="using-weave-scope-in-cloud-service-mode"></a>Using Weave Scope in Cloud Service Mode

Scope can also be used to feed reports to the Scope Service. The Scope Service
allows you centrally manage and share access to your Scope UI. In this
configuration, you only run the probe locally; the apps are hosted for you.

To get an account on the Scope Service, sign up at [scope.weave.works][]. You
need to run a probe on every machine you want to monitor with Scope. To launch
a probe and send reports to the service, run the following command:

[scope.weave.works]: http://scope.weave.works

```
sudo scope launch --service-token=<token>
```

## <a name="launching-weave-scope-and-compose-in-cloud-service-mode"></a>Launching Weave Scope and Docker Compose in Cloud Service Mode

The SCOPE_SERVICE_TOKEN is found when you [log in to the Scope service](https://scope.weave.works/) - launch Docker Compose with one of the two fragments below and the value of the token set as an environment variable:

    SCOPE_SERVICE_TOKEN=abcdef_my_token  docker-compose up -d

### Docker Compose format version 2:

    version: '2'
    services:
      probe:
        image: weaveworks/scope:0.13.1
        network_mode: "host"
        pid: "host"
        privileged: true

## <a name="using-weave-scope-with-amazon-ecs"></a>Using Weave Scope with Amazon's EC2 Container Service

We currently provide three options for launching Weave Scope in ECS:

* A [CloudFormation template](https://www.weave.works/deploy-weave-aws-cloudformation-template/) to launch and easily evaluate Scope directly from your browser.
* An [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://github.com/weaveworks/integrations/tree/master/aws/ecs#weaves-ecs-amis) for each ECS region.
* [A simple way to tailor the AMIs to your needs](https://github.com/weaveworks/integrations/tree/master/aws/ecs#creating-your-own-customized-weave-ecs-ami).

## <a name="using-weave-scope-with-kubernetes"></a>Using Weave Scope with Kubernetes

Scope comes with built-in Kubernetes support. We recommend to run Scope natively
in your Kubernetes cluster using the manifest generator service.

The simplest way to get latest release of Scope deployed on a Kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl create -f 'https://scope.weave.works/k8s-gen/weavescope.json' --validate=false
```

There a few parameters you can specify:

  - `v` - Weave Scope version or tag, e.g. `latest` or `0.15.0`, current release is the default

  - `service-token` - Weave Scope Cloud Service token

  - `k8s-service-type` - Kubernetes service type (for running Scope in Standalone mode), can be either
    `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`, by default this is unspecifed (only internal access)

If you wish to download Scope manifest, you can use YAML version of the manifest, as it's easier to read, i.e.:
```
curl --silent --remote-name https://scope.weave.works/k8s-gen/weavescope.yaml
```

### Open Scope in your browser

   * When running Scope in Standalone mode do (without `k8s-service-type`):

     ```
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pod --selector=weavescope-component=weavescope-app -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) 4040
```

     and open [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) in your browser. This allows you to access the Scope UI securely, without
         opening it to the Internet.

   * When running Scope in Standalone mode with `k8s-service-type=(NodePort|LoadBalancer)`:

     ```
kubectl describe svc weavescope-app
```

   * When running Scope in Cloud Service mode, simply log in to [https://scope.weave.works](https://scope.weave.works)

### Additional Notes


1. Make sure your cluster allows privileged pods (required by the Scope
   probes). Privileged pods are allowed by default from Kubernetes 1.1.
   If you are running an earlier version or a non-default configuration,
   make sure your API Server and all your Kubelets are provided with flag `--allow_privileged`
   at launch time.

2. Make sure
   [DaemonSets](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/daemon.md)
   are enabled in your cluster (enabled by default from
   Kubernetes 1.2). DaemonSets are needed to ensure that each Kubernetes node
   runs a Scope Probe:

   * To enable DaemonSets in an existing cluster, make sure to add a
     `--runtime-config=extensions/v1beta1/daemonsets=true` argument to the
     [apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/admin/kube-apiserver.md)'s configuration
     (normally found at `/etc/kubernetes/manifest/kube-apiserver.manifest`) followed by a
     [restart of the apiserver and controller manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/18656).

   * If you are creating a new cluster, set `KUBE_ENABLE_DAEMONSETS=true` in
     your cluster configuration.

   * Note that prior to Kubernetes version 1.2 DaemonSets would fail to schedule pods on
     unschedulable nodes (typically the master).  This will result in the probe
     not running on that node.  See [#1030](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/issues/1030)
     for more information.  We advise you to use Kubernetes version 1.2 or higher.


## <a name="probe_plugins"></a>Scope Probe Plugins

Scope allows you to create plugins generating custom
metrics. Those metrics will be displayed in the Scope UI.

Here is an annotated screenshot of Scope while executing a plugin which extracts
incoming HTTP request rates of your application without instrumenting it.

<img src="imgs/plugin.png" width="400" alt="Scope Probe plugin screenshot" align="center">


You can read more about Scope Probe plugins and find some examples
[here](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/tree/master/examples/plugins).

## <a name="developing"></a>Developing

Building Scope from source depends on the latest version of
[docker](https://www.docker.com/), so please install that before
proceeding.

The main build is `make`, which builds the UI build container, builds
the UI in said container, builds the backend build container, builds
the app and probe in said container, and finally pushes the lot into
a Docker image called **weaveworks/scope**.

```
make
```

Then, run the local build via

```
./scope launch
```

If needed, install tools used for managing dependencies, managing releases, and doing coverage analysis via

```
make deps
```

Note that the tools from `make deps` will depend on a local install of
[Go](https://golang.org).

## <a name="developing"></a>Debugging

Scope has a collection of built-in debugging tools to aid Scope developers.

- To get debug information in the logs launch Scope with `--debug`:
```
scope launch --debug
docker logs weavescope
```

- To have the Scope App or Scope Probe dump their goroutine stacks, run:
```
kill -QUIT $(pgrep -f scope-(app|probe))
docker logs weavescope
```

- The Scope Probe is instrumented with various counters and timers. To have it dump those values, run:
```
kill -USR1 $(pgrep -f scope-probe)
docker logs weavescope
```

Both the Scope App and the Scope Probe offer [HTTP endpoints with profiling information](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/).
These cover things such as CPU usage and memory consumption:
- The Scope App enables its HTTP profiling endpoints by default, which
  are accessible on the same port the Scope UI is served (4040).
- The Scope Probe doesn't enable its profiling endpoints by default.
  To enable them, you must launch Scope with `--probe.http.listen addr:port`.
  For instance, launching Scope with `scope launch --probe.http.listen :4041`, will
  allow you access the Scope Probe's profiling endpoints on port 4041.

Then, you can collect profiles in the usual way. For instance:

- To collect the memory profile of the Scope App:

```
go tool pprof http://localhost:4040/debug/pprof/heap
```

- To collect the CPU profile of the Scope Probe:

```
go tool pprof http://localhost:4041/debug/pprof/profile
```

If you don't have `go` installed, you can use a Docker container instead:

- To collect the memory profile of the Scope App:

```
docker run --net=host -v $PWD:/root/pprof golang go tool pprof http://localhost:4040/debug/pprof/heap
```

- To collect the CPU profile of the Scope Probe:

```
docker run --net=host -v $PWD:/root/pprof golang go tool pprof http://localhost:4041/debug/pprof/profile
```

You will find the output profiles in your working directory.  To analyse the dump, do something like:

```
go tool pprof prog/scope pprof.localhost\:4040.samples.cpu.001.pb.gz
Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands)
(pprof) pdf >cpu.pdf
```
