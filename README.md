## Overview

Weave Scope automatically generates a map of your containers, enabling you to
intuitively understand, monitor, and control your applications.


## Getting started

```
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/scope \
  https://github.com/weaveworks/scope/releases/download/latest_release/scope
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope
sudo scope launch
```

This script will download and run a recent Scope image from the Docker Hub.
Now, open your web browser to **http://localhost:4040**. (If you're using
boot2docker, replace localhost with the output of `boot2docker ip`.)


## Requirements

Scope does not need any configuration and does not require the Weave Network.
But Scope does need to be running on every machine you want to monitor.


## Architecture

Weave Scope consists of two components: the app and the probe. These two
components are deployed as a single Docker container using the `scope`
script.

The probe is responsible for gathering information about the host is it running
on. This information is sent to the app in the form of a report. The app is
responsible for processing reports from the probe into usable topologies,
serving the UI, and pushing these topologies to the UI.

```
+--Docker host----------+
|  +--Container------+  |    .---------------.
|  |                 |  |    | Browser       |
|  |  +-----------+  |  |    |---------------|
|  |  | scope-app |<---------|               |
|  |  +-----------+  |  |    |               |
|  |        ^        |  |    |               |
|  |        |        |  |    '---------------'
|  | +-------------+ |  |
|  | | scope-probe | |  |
|  | +-------------+ |  |
|  |                 |  |
|  +-----------------+  |
+-----------------------+
```

## Multi host setup

When running Scope in a cluster, each probe sends reports to each app.
The App merges the reports from each probe into a more complete report.
You need to run Scope on every machine you want to monitor.

```
+--Docker host----------+      +--Docker host----------+
|  +--Container------+  |      |  +--Container------+  |
|  |                 |  |      |  |                 |  |
|  |  +-----------+  |  |      |  |  +-----------+  |  |
|  |  | scope-app |<-----.    .----->| scope-app |  |  |
|  |  +-----------+  |  | \  / |  |  +-----------+  |  |
|  |        ^        |  |  \/  |  |        ^        |  |
|  |        |        |  |  /\  |  |        |        |  |
|  | +-------------+ |  | /  \ |  | +-------------+ |  |
|  | | scope-probe |-----'    '-----| scope-probe | |  |
|  | +-------------+ |  |      |  | +-------------+ |  |
|  |                 |  |      |  |                 |  |
|  +-----------------+  |      |  +-----------------+  |
+-----------------------+      +-----------------------+
```

If you run Scope on the same machine as the Weave Network, the probe will use
weaveDNS to automatically discover other apps on your network. Scope acheives
this by registering itself under the address **scope.weave.local**. Each probe
will send reports to every app registered under this address. Therefore, if
you have a running weaveDNS setup, you do not need to take any further steps.

If you do not wish to use weaveDNS, you can instruct Scope to cluster with
other Scope instances on the command line. Hostnames and IP addresses are
acceptable, both with and without ports:

```
# scope launch scope1:4030 192.168.0.12 192.168.0.11:4030
```

Hostnames will be regularly resolved as A records, and each answer used as a
target.

## Using Scope Service

Scope can also be used to feed reports to the Scope Service. The Scope Service
allows you centrally manage and share access to your Scope UI. In this
configuration, you only run the probe locally; the apps are hosted for you.

To get an account on the Scope Service, sign up at [scope.weave.works][]. You
need to run a probe on every machine you want to monitor with Scope. To launch
a probe and send reports to the service, run the following command:

[scope.weave.works]: http://scope.weave.works

```
sudo scope launch --service-token=<token>
```

```

## Developing

The build is in five stages. `make deps` installs some tools we use later in
the build. `make frontend` builds a UI build image with all NPM dependencies.
`make static` compiles the UI into `static.go` which is part of the repository
for convenience. The final `make` builds the app and probe, in a container,
and pushes the lot into a Docker image called **weaveworks/scope**.

```
make deps
make frontend
make static
make
```

Then, run the local build via

```
./scope launch
```
