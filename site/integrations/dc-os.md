Scope provides a simple live map of your application without requiring any instrumentation or coding, and can be installed as a DC/OS Package through the open Universe.

DC/OS is short for Datacenter Operating System, a distributed operating system using Apache Mesos as its kernel. The easiest way to get start with DC/OS in the public-cloud is to [deploy it on Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://mesosphere.com/amazon/).

How to install the Weave Scope packages on DC/OS and where it can be useful to you while developing a distributed application that targets DC/OS is described.
