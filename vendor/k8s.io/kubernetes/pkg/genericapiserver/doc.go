// Package genericapiserver contains code to setup a generic kubernetes-like API server.
// This does not contain any kubernetes API specific code.
// Note that this is a work in progress. We are pulling out generic code (specifically from
// pkg/master and pkg/apiserver) here.
// We plan to move this package into a separate repo on github once it is done.
// For more details: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/2742
